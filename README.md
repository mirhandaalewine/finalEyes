# Moving Eyes
## About:
Moving Eyes creates two eyeballs on the page with responsive pupils. When the user moves their mouse around, the pupils move with them. This allows the user to immitate eye movements, such as eyerolls, side eye, etc. 
## Steps for Use:
In order to use this project, you can fork and clone this repository to make any updates.
## Future Improvements:
In the future, I'd like to add some irises to the eyes and create some logic that would change the size of the pupils to immitate various emotions, such as surprise.
## License:
This project comes from a course provided by Emeritus X MIT.
